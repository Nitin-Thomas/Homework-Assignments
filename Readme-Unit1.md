## Robo-Advising disrupting the world of Personal Finance

## Landscape
<div align="Justify">
The idea of Robo-Advising, and the disruptions it could pose to the traditional Financial Advisory industry was not unfamiliar to even the smallest of family run advisory firms, in the most discreetest towns of sub-urban India. The movement became an inevitable endeavor as early as the year 2005. Infact, almost everyday, there were a few new youtube and tv ads popping up, introducing creative ways to manage personal finance. Family Run advisory firms were on the lookout of cost effective technology compmanies that would mine data so that advisors could discover methods to transition into a data-driven advising model and portfolio allocation. Infact, it became quite obvious that to the novice investor that they could get started for less, pay less but earn more. While advisors were not exactly savvy at using data to drive their advice, they certainly had these tag lines on their website - 'automated service to grow their money', 'automatically comes up with an investment portfolio', 'automated investment tools in the market' etc. The word 'automated' or 'automatically' was meant to ease the investor into the concept of using technology to guide investment, but not entirely remove the 'human' component that meant personalization, care, empathy, accountability etc to many.

## Market Opportunity
Opportunity has two dimensions. Better advice Even today, a large number of clients, whether associated with the big banks or credit unions, are not offered any meaningful advisory services. Those that do have a dedicated Financial Advisor, usually have meetings only when there is a specific need or an annual meeting to adhere with compliance. Finance is an everyday affair - and financial health is a combination of many choices. For investors, the more simplified, descriptive, graphical and forward-looking, the better. The coining of technology with finance, the advent of FinTech was certainly the way to go.

[//]: < When was the company incorporated?>
[//]: < Who are the founders of the company?>
[//]: <How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?>

SoFi Inc, or Social Finance was one such FinTech Company that was designed to penetrate the Personal Finance and Advisory industry. Founded in San Francisco, in the year 2011, by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, who were, at the time, Stanford Business school students<sup>[1]</sup>,

[//]:<What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?>
SoFi was originally meant to provide affordable options for student loan financing to debt laden fresh graduates, who were having a hard time finding gainful integrating into a recovering economy that followed the Great Recession.<sup>[2]</sup> The loan program started off with $2 million from 40 Stanford alumni, disbursed to 85 students at the business school. After their initial success, in 2012 they expanded the program to 40 universities, with $150 million, backed by almuni.

[//]: <How is the company funded?>
Crowdfunding or the Crowdsourcing lending program was popular in several innovative ways, first with the elimination of overhead costs as incurred by traditional banks. Rather, the savings was transferred to customers and investors. As an example, from 2012 - 2013 SoFi's offered interest rates as low as 5.99%, almost 300-400 basis points lower than many private loans from big banks.  

[//]:<Who is the company's intended customer?>
By pairing students borrowers with alumni lenders, better networking, mentorship and qualitative guidance were the value added services provided by this lending model. Consequently, risk scoring and underwriting process for student loans were improved in a way that reduced default risk to nearly 0% when the national average was 14%. <sup>[3]</sup>

In 2017, SoFi's popularity suffered a setback when the company's leadership faced damaging allegations, and seemingly recked future prospects. However, within a few months, the company announced that Anthony Noto, then COO of Twitter, would take charge as CEO of SoFi. Pre-Noto, SoFi was a lending company focussed on Student Loan Refinancing, Mortgage, Personal Loans and Credit Cards. Post-Noto, SoFi, while still leaning heavily on lending, added a whole suite of financial services, commission-free trades, robo-investing, fractional shares, cryptocurrency trading, SoFi ETF's, Financial Planing and Cash Management.

[//]: <How much funding have they received?>
[//]: <Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?> 
SoFi's revenue comes from commissions and management fees on account services. In 2021, SoFi(NASDAQ:SOFI) became a publically traded company after merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, which is a special purpose acquitsition company (SPAC) that exists only to bring private companies to the stock market<sup>[4]</sup>. SoFi currently has a market cap of approx. $18 billion, and a user base of approx. 2.5 million<sup>[8]</sup>.

In the era where the smartphone and tablet have almost replaced the PC or desktop computer, and where millenials and Gen Z customers are glued to their mobile handheld devices, customers want immediacy, quick transactions and quick one-click sign up for all their needs. In this context, traditional banking has been met with a digital realignment in its operating and working style.

Traditional banks are also making moves to integrate technology and Big Data to offer banking services and customized solutions, along with digital signatures, increased cybersecurity measures and 24/7 access to keep up with one-click culture. <sup>[5]</sup>.

Companies like Lending Club, Lendkey, Earnest are competitors to SoFi in the student loan refinancing segment<sup>[6]</sup>v, while Betterment, Weathsimple, Human Interest are comparables known to offer one or more key differntiators in full suite banking services segment.<sup>[7]</sup>. To summarize, any entity, including traditional banks, with consumer data and technologocal prowess can become a competitor and a FinTech player.

Furthermore, SoFi is the only one that offers loans to its members. This key offering is likely acquire the increasing number of young, high-income millenials and Gen Z customers. This demographic tailwind is a significant growth catalyst for the next decade<sup>[9]</sup>.

## Recommendations
[//]:<Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?>
The Digital Ecosystem, being a group of interconnected information technology resources that work as a single unit, converting a single transaction to a journey. A study conducted by McKinsey.com, indicate that many sectors like B2B services, Mobility, Travel, Hospitality, Health and Housing are re-inventing ecosystems by building networks of networks that could add upto $60 trillion into the economy by 2025. Sofi is a one-stop-shop for personal finance and some of these 'lifestyle' additions could get SoFi closer to creating that ecosystem.

[//]:<If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)>
 > **Digital Environment and Value Added Services**<br></br>
 >Traditional banks, in order to make their digital offerings attractive, provide promotions for premium online services like streaming, entertainment, learning, shopping or food delivery. It's also quite common for credit cards to have cash back or travel points and lounge passes by accumulating points. Crypto trading platforms offer credit cards with tons of add-ons like a free Netflix subscription when you sign up. Drawing from these examples, and with common knowledge that these other services are a lifestyle now, it is a good opportunity to consolidate the digital environment and give users an equitable position to have all these value added services and save money that can be put to better use. 

 > **Learning & Development**<br></br>
> Financial literacy has become increasingly important for government and citizens when economic health and stability are concerned. The World Bank Financial literacy program focusses on improving this understanding for School students and college students, so that they can bring this modern financial knowledge to their homes and communities<sup>[10]</sup>. In the long run, it would translate to better allocation of capital, from savers to investors to. Trading Platforms for practice and mobile app games would be a creative way to muster inquisitiveness into the field.

[//]:<What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?>
[//]:<Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?>
With various plug-ins and data sources available as 'services', an ecosystem does not require every service to be made in-house. Rather, partnering with other participants can unleash innovation and new efficiencies along the value chain. However, 5G for stable connections, Data (which the ecosystem can provide), AI models, Cloud facilities are key to build such an ecosystem. More efficient cybersecurity protocols, effective regulations and Privacy protocols cannot escape from becoming the foundation of any platform, to project reliability and accountability (especially when there isn't a physical place to run to)<sup>[15]</sup>.

Quite evident already with the Apple, Google and Samsung ecosystems - housing Communication, Technology, Finance, Health, Entertainment, Productivity, Learning and development and much more. An ecosystem bridges gaps along the value chain by creating a unified value proposition through a customer centric gateway that reduces subscription costs for customers and provide new experiences and appetite for new products. A survey reveals that 7 out 10 consumers were pro-ecosystem because it is viewed as a journey rather than a transaction - now that's a trend setter!
